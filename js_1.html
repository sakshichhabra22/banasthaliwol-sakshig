<div class="pa">Why Study JavaScript?</div>
<div class="pg"><pre>JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

   Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.

   Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript.
 
   Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB

   and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.</pre></div>
<div class="wk"><h2>Did You Know?</h2>

   <p>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in
   concept and design.</p>
   <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA
   standard in 1997.</p>
  <p> ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the 
   official name of the language.</p>
