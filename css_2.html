<p class="sk">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
<ul class="sl">
<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
<li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
<li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>

<div class="se">Why Use CSS?
</div>

<div class="sl">CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</div>
<div class="se">CSS Solved a Big Problem</div>
<div class="sl"><pre>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification,

 it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites,

 where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</pre></div>

<div class="se">CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</div>
<div class="sl"><p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
</p>
<p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
